1,What is the difference between == and .equals() in Java?,Basics,Easy,== checks reference equality; .equals() checks logical equality when overridden.,"==, .equals, reference equality"
2,Explain Java memory model: stack vs heap.,Memory,Easy,Stack stores local primitives and references; heap stores objects and is managed by GC.,"stack, heap, garbage collector"
